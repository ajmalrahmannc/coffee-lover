        <h1>About Us</h1>

            conversations. Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees
            are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a
            part of their lives.CCD to the youth is a “hangout” spot where they meet people, make conversations, and
            have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.It's been an exciting journey since then to
            becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country.
            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
            species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green
            coffee.</p>
